OWL_school.1.t:0 "Foreign Exchange Student"
OWL_school.1.d:0 "“I gotta admit. It's extra weird being here, without you yelling at me for picking fights or stealing...”\n\n“I can easily change that.”\n\nTo the surprise of Principal Hieronymus Bump of the Hexside School of Magic and Demonics, an old pupil of his had found her way into his office as he was working with administrative paperwork. It was an understatement that Eda Clawthorne had a reputation from her time in Hexside. How the connection of her enrollment there to her being one of the most wanted wild witches in the Isles was kept under wraps is one of the best PR ploys Bump orchestrated in his tenure as principal. It didn't mean he wasn’t sympathetic to one of the the most skilled magic users to grace Hexside’s halls.\n\n“I want to enroll my human, Luz, at Hexside. And before you get all judgy-”\n\n“That's not a bad idea.”\n\nEda sat up, “You no-good—Wait, really?”\n\nBump walked over to his filing cabinet, “I think the student body could learn a lot from having such an exchange student.” Eda smiled, one that quickly turned when Bump dropped a large stack of paper and folders on his desk in front of her, “But before I even consider that, there's a lot to be answered for.”\n\n“Huh. I thought there'd be more?”\n\nShe dreaded at the thought of what she had to atone for at Hexside to get Luz into the school."

BOI_frost.1.t:0 "Cold Reception"
BOI_frost.1.d:0 "As Belos sat in his throne, rubbing the mask over his forehead, Kikimora walked into the inner sanctum of the Emperor’s Castle.\n\n“Lord Belos. A message from Snapdragon. It's concerning the recent frost...”\n\nAs any young witchlin would have read in their official history books, the great and expansive fields of the Titan’s chest is the largest breadbasket in the Boiling Isles. Referred to as the “Nurturing Bosom of the Titan”, to the snickering of many witchlins, this area was historically important to the many old kingdoms on the Isles that depended on it for food. Many important merchant cities like Menice were born from the trade routes.\n\nThe Chest was never always so providing, though. In the Savage Ages, a major part of the chest was plagued by a bitter and eternal frost once called, “The Dying Breath of the Titan”. But of course, the great Emperor Belos arose from the warm beating heart and purged the wild magic that caused this. By the Titan’s Will and the Emperor’s Coven, the once cold, dead land became a land of warm, bustling fields. From the farms and ranches that feed the Isles to the finest orchards and vineries for Apple Blood and Vine, all of the Boiling Isles owed their full stomachs and quenched thirst to Emperor Belos.\n\nBut times seem to be changing once more. The Plant Coven and its head witch, Terra Snapdragon, administers this region of the Isles. A hesitantly but equally hastily written report tells that temperatures have dropped in recent weeks and farmers worry the crops may fail before harvest season. Worst, her coven has not yet identified the cause of this climate change. Snapdragon is now asking for assistance from the Construction Coven to set up large scale heat stones to warm the region up as she continues her investigation.\n\nKikimora awaited an answer from Belos. In his headache, he seemed to contemplate what was the real cause for this temperature shift, something only he would have known from when he lifted it decades ago. But his focus was on a bigger goal. A bad harvest was of little concern, if even helpful to what he wished to achieve."
BOI_frost.1.a:0 "“Authorize additional help from the other covens to handle this matter, quickly!”"
BOI_frost.1.b:0 "“Tell Snapdragon to resolve this problem with what resources she has, now!”"

GEU_ULN.1.t:0 "Sending A Message"
GEU_ULN.1.d:0 "The situation in North America is dire.\n\nTo the west, the salamander King Andrias of Amphibia continues his conquest of California and Nevada after the superteen Anne Boonchuy lost the one on one match against the king and Western US defenses collapsed following their defeat at Hoover Dam. In the East, magical raiders known as Titan Trappers from the Demon Realm, following their cult leader the Collector, have already overwhelmed Eastern US forces in Boston and New York and are on the verge of breaking out past the Appalachians to find more unfortunate “players” for their “Owl House” game.\n\nHaving retreated from their HQ in New York to the old HQ in Geneva, the United League of Nations Protection Council has convened on the matter. Absent from the Council meeting was the US, as both the Trembley and Curtis Administrations had collapsed, and Canada, who had inherited its seat from Great Britain and was still gone in the Kerfuffle. This left only the United Republic of China, the Fourth French Empire which represented the European Union, and the Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan for the Soviet Union, which consisted of itself and its neighboring -Stan nations. Is Nice!\n\nThe Debate was not nice, however. Though having interdimensional invaders is bad, some debated that the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean will protect the old world from the fall of the new world. Others were adamant of retaking North America. The first plan would be to land Elite Sino-European forces in Florida and Washington State to blunt the invaders, then send wave after wave of conscripts from Tsarist Russia until all the frobots and witches were driven out. The other plan involved sending a series of strict diplomatic telegrams to King Andrias and the Collector, then taking a siesta.\n\nFinally, after long debate, the Protection Council has made their decision."
