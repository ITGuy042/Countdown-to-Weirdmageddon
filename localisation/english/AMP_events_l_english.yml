AMP_pirate.1.d:0 "A new petition to the king has arrived at the gates of Newtopia. Recently, a band of pirates has plagued the bay, attacking ships for their precious cargo and disrupting trade between the city and the rest of Amphibia.\n\nAs these trade routes bring precious food and material to the city, it is vital the pirate states that have taken control of the key area around the Bay of Leviathan be dealt with. Two plans have been brought forward to King Andrias. The king’s advisors, Bartley, Branson, and Blair, have proposed a new round of military build up to directly challenge the pirate states. They even recommend bringing the famous warship “The Green Lady'' out of the Museum and into service for the navy.\n\nMeanwhile, General Yunan and the human Ranger Marcy Wu have proposed an infiltration mission instead. The pirates, surprisingly, have a very clear organizational structure which has allowed them to outsmart and outmaneuver even the local toad warlords in the area. If they can infiltrate and gain power, they could be turned from rogue bandits to loyal privateers at the service of the crown.\n\nThe plan is risky though. Yunan is already well known for such a mission, and Marcy is a bit too unknown for the pirates to simply trust. But at the same time, Newtopia is not in the best position to mobilize forces beyond its own gates, let alone the city limits. Lady Olivia awaits King Andrias decision on the matter."

WRT_election.1.t:0 "First Past The Stand"
WRT_election.1.d:0 "The race for the mayorship of the Valley Town of Wartwood Swamp has been a fierce competition. At its start, it was assumed the current mayor, Frodrick Toadstool, would once again carry the vote, if only out of apathy for the election. But it was the entrance of Wartwood Farmer Hopediah Planter that changed all that. With his vegetable stand taken away from him, "Hop Pop" rose up to challenge Toadstool with the initial backing of the town frogs. For him, this is a chance to make a difference and not be some loser backwater frog.\n\nAs tradition, each of them were put through their limits on a series of mayoral trials that would demonstrate their ability. From mounting giant beetles to a fierce boxing match, Hop Pop emerged victorious in the trials, overcoming both challenges of strength and character to carry the day. But now the results are in. All the residents of the Valley would be voting for the mayor of the most pivotal town in the Valley, not just Wartwood. But turnout from Wartwood itself is already at a record high. Who shall decide the mayoral race? Who shall win the election?"
