 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_EARTH.1.t:0 "Our Pride through the Long Summer"
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_EARTH.1.d:0 "Though America was divided, her Pride wasn’t. Across the US, LGBTQ Celebrations were still held for Pride Month. In San Francisco’s famous Pride Parade, Emperor Norton waved to the crowd on Market Street as the openly-bi Lt. Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman marched alongside with his family, both representing the Imperial Pride and Progressive Spirit of California.\n\nNorth, President Trembley lead Portland’s Pride Parade and ended up fighting a “homophobic” Bald Eagle halfway through. On the East Coast, President Curtis held his own parade in D.C., essentially a “colorful” military parade while reminding everyone he repealed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” Policy. Even though America was divided, its people would stay true and be free to be as they are."

 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_MEWNI.1.t:0 "Royal Rainbow Colors"
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_MEWNI.1.d:0 "Today, a parade was being held in the city surrounding Butterfly Castle. It was a “Pride Parade,” a celebration that Star Butterfly brought to Mewni after spending time on Earth. Intended to uplift the LGBTQ community on Mewni, the parade marched on through the recently cleaned cobble streets, a strange amalgamation of LGBTQ representation and Fauxthentic Californian culture.\n\nReportedly, Princess Star tried to enhance the main festivities with a magical rainbow light show near the parade’s end. But instead she had created a flaming rainbow which rained fire down onto the city. Chaos naturally ensued. But if you tilted your head, squinted your eyes, and squeezed some californian lemon juice in them, you could still make out a colorful pride celebration in the kingdom."
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_MEWNI.1.da:0 "Today, the now annual Pride Celebrations on Mewni was being held in Port Festiva. The Pride March was just the start as it led to the city’s park where a Pride Festival held the main activities of the event. Here, the celebration had garnished its own Mewman flavor, a mix of a modern human celebration and a mewman renaissance fair.\n\nInterestingly, Princess Star was not present at the festivities. Given how the last pride event went, some assumed she wasn’t invited. But kingdom officials assured attendees she was on Earth for their equivalent event. For some Mewmans, it brought a sigh of relief. Better the Crown Princess was spreading rainbow “cheer” to the humans than them."
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_MEWNI.1.a:0 "At least the pride parades of Mewni are memorable..."
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_MEWNI.1.b:0 "Amazing, especially with how that parade went last week..."
 
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_AMPHI.1.t:0 "Parading through Newtopia!"
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_AMPHI.1.d:0 "Excited cheers could be heard throughout the streets of Newtopia. Head Ranger Marcy, a human that had garnered the favor of King Andrias, had introduced a new concept to the LGBTQ+ community of the Amphibia. The concept of a Pride Celebration had started to gain traction in recent weeks, accumulating to a massive Pride Parade through the streets of the capital city. It only made sense that the human Marcy led the parade as its Grand Marshal.\n\nBeneath the rainbow flag being waved at the head of the main parade was the famous General Yunnan and the king’s advisor, Lady Olivia, sparking conversation of the pairing. Regardless, this month on Amphibia was now a time to have pride in who you are."
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_AMPHI.1.a:0 "What a festive time in Newtopia"
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_AMPHI.1.b:0 "What a festi- Wait, have we done this already?"
 
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_BOILI.1.t:0 "Painbow Pride!"
 GLOBAL_NEWS_PRIDE_BOILI.1.d:0 "On the Boiling Isles, two different pride marches could be observed. One Pride Parade was organized by the Emperor’s Coven and was to show the LGBTQ+‘s support of the Emperor. It was much more well organized and had witches walking in marching order, waving their drab painbow flags. At the end of the march, they all gave their thanks to Emperor Belos for their “pride”.\n\nThe other march was a chaotic, yet more truly free event in the expansive forest of the Right Arm. At the Owl House of the infamous wild witch, it was a much more lively celebration, where young witches and a human that was a wild witch in heart were truly able to be themselves. It was a place that represented what the Boiling Isles truly was."
