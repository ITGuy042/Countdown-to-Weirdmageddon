mewni_solaria.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Queen Solaria"
mewni_solaria.1.d:0 "Three hundred years ago, a newly crowned Queen Solaria Butterfly rallied the numerous Mewman kingdoms for a grand campaign. Her mission, that she proclaimed to the Butterfly kingdom on the very night of her coronation, was to bring the entire dimension of Menwi under the rule of Mewmankind. She rallied her armies, perfected the great magic of the Butterfly Line, and began a long and glorious war to crush the monster filth.\n\nShe undoubtedly succeeded, and brought about an unprecedented golden age of Mewman supremacy. Her leadership drove the monster hordes into the Underworld and the Forest of Certain Death, where they still remain fighting amongst themselves. Thanks to her keen interest in alliance building, spearheaded by her older brother, Prince Jushtin Butterfly, she gave birth to the system that stands today as the Kingdom of Mewni. And it would be her dying wish that ensured that through centuries of dynasties and political changes, the Butterfly Family would have everlasting hegemonoy over all of Mewni."

mewni_300_peace.1.t:0 "300 Years of Domination"
mewni_300_peace.1.d:0 "Mewni has enjoyed three hundred years of domination after Solaria's generation set it up. There is no doubt of what was accomplished during that time. But it was not an era of "happily ever after." The whole dimension is entering a new era, political alliances are now being tested and strained. The old social order facing challenges from rapidly evolving foes. The economy has stagnated due to minimal reform, the entire economy relying on exporting the corn crop. Even the monsters, who were so utterly crushed three centuries ago, are now starting to recover.\n\n And there is of course, the odd radical and revolutionary here and there. Spewing foreign doctrines of "Freedom" and "Democracy." But they are few and far between."
mewni_300_peace.1.a:0 "We live in interesting times."

butterfly_family.1.t:0 "House Butterfly"
butterfly_family.1.d:0 "The Butterfly family has ruled most of Mewni since the great Queen Solaria led the glorious fight against the monsters and secured Mewnipendance. Having secured the Mewman’s goal of "Life, Safety, and Corn" the monarchy under House Butterfly has led their kingdom, and by extension most of the Mewman race, through the golden age of Mewman peace. But not all is easy, as in the recent years the reluctance to reform has begun to show it's concequences.\n\nThe Queen Comet Crisis, which had the current Queen Butterfly rise to the throne after her mother was slain by the Monster Toffee, almost had Mewni be plunged into war once again. However, Queen Moon protected her people and prevented the crisis from starting total war. And as a new era dawns on the Mewman dimension, everyone looks to Moon and the Butterfly family for guidance."

MEW_prolouge_end.1.t:0 "Princess and Heiress"
MEW_prolouge_end.1.d:0 "Princess Star of House Butterfly, heiress to the Mewman throne, is 9 years old. These formative years of her childhood requires a carefully customized education in order for her to truly act like royalty. Unfortunately, the situation in the south will have to take precedence. All we can do is trust that a standardized education will suit her.\n\nIt's not all bad though. Every heir in the various Kingdoms that make up the Kingdom of Mewni are of similar age. Thus, all rulers of Mewni could be friends from childhood in the next generation. And there is of course always the possibility of an alliance through marriage."

mew_ost_situation.1.t:0 "Situation in the South"
mew_ost_situation.1.d:0 "To the southwest, across the Mewni waterway, lies the Ostro Starvarian Empire. An empire which consists of a ruling aristocrat class of Ostritches, while the majority of the servant population are divided by the Starvarians and the Pigeons. It is an infighting, divided state who's government operates on bribes and nepotisim. It is a ripe, low hanging fruit for a war to bring glory to Mewni and reinvigorate the Mewman spirit."

She is even wearing her old formal millitary uniform, having it finally see the light of day after about 30 years.\n\nShe apparently has no desire to take up public office again, and her doctors are saying that her going out and doing things is good for her mental health. She already has a team of professionals on standby incase she gets too rowdy."

old_discoveries.1.t:0 "Odd Discovery"
old_discoveries.1.d:0 "As our forces advanced through the countryside, a patrol scouting through a forest came upon a small abandon camp. Given how far it was from the front line, we doubt it was used by the Ostro-Starvarians. Actually, the camp was quite old and when Sir Stabby and his men investigated, the real mystery was found. The camp was once a resting point for the evil monster warlord Toffee!\n\nFurther examination of the camp confirmed it was abandon in a hurry and most of its ruin was the result of a battle. Besides some paperwork left behind confirming Toffee’s presence here, something truly interesting was found. Small brass tubes were found close to one another on the grounds where the main tent once was. Near it was a torn-up patch with what looks like an eagle with a magnifying glass, but we were barely able to identify that, let alone anything else about it. Our scientist at Skywynne Institute believe these things are of Human origin, given the carving on the brass tubes that read, in Terran English and Low Mewman, as “CATO 5.56mm”.\n\nAccording to scholars, CATO is a major military alliance on Earth. But it begs the question..."

old_discoveries.2.t:0 "The Wonders of the Age of Solaria"
old_discoveries.2.d:0 "A long time ago, Mewni was at war with the monsters that plague the land. Under the great leadership of Queen Solaria, we drove the monsters away. Along with advance magic that have since been lost to all but the Royal Family and the MHC, many technological wonders litter the land where ancient battles were once fought three hundred years ago.\n\nAs our forces march through Ostro-Starvaria, we came upon what the wise men accompanying our knights called “steam powered motors”.  It is believed these metal machines were invented by Council Alphonse the Worthy, a close “confidant” of Queen Solaria. Allowing the use of "Horse-less Carriages", these machines of steam would burn ethanol from common energy spores and could transport troops and supplies at great speeds without the need and limitations of horses, allowing Solaria to battle the monsters with ease across multiple fronts. After Alphonse perished during the invasion of the Underworld, most of these technologies were lost. It seems the Ostro-Starvarians managed to restore the ancient machines and restore parts of the old decaying roads for fast travel. \n\nSkywynne Institute will have a field day with these captured engines from the Age of Solaria."
old_discoveries.2.a:0 "Maybe our corn rations will arrive on time..."

star_tom_start_decision.2.t:0 "Mother's Advice"
star_tom_start_decision.2.d:0 ""Hey, Mom? Can I talk to you for a bit?"\n\nQueen Moon Butterfly looked up from her paperwork. "Sure, sweetie. What do you want to talk about?"\n\n"Uhm... I actually wanted some advice. About relationships."\n\nMoon raised an eyebrow. "Has something about Tom been bothering you?"\n\n"Oh, no no! Tom's been great! I just... I wanna talk about hypotheticals."\n\n"Hm. Well, it's always good to have a backup plan. Go on, what's your question?"\n\n"So lets say that I... lost interest in Tom. I don't want to be with him anymore. Hypothetically. Now, personally I would want to break up with him. But since Tom is part of the Lucitor family, me breaking up with him would worsen relations with them. So what should I do?"\n\nQueen Moon smiled at the fact that Star was thinking about political affairs at this level, but then her smile turned to a frown. "You arent thinking of breaking up with Tom, are you?"\n\n"What? No, of course not!" She laughed it off. "This is just a theory, a relationship theory!" Then her face turned serious. "So what's your advice?""
star_tom_start_decision.2.a:0 ""If it's what your heart desires, then break up with him.""
star_tom_start_decision.2.b:0 ""The matters of the state take precedence. Stay with him.""

star_tom_start.3.t:0 "Star and Tom break up!"
star_tom_start.3.d:0 "Star and Tom have broken up, ending their relationship! Details are scarce, but it is beleived that the break up was not clean. Star was trying to explain what had happened, but she was incomprehensible due to the angry crying she was doing at the same time.\n\nWith the break up, the future seems less certain. But with Star being single, it gives us the oppourtunity for more political leverage."

But instead of going to St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses as per usual, we will do something new.

emergency_economics_3.1.d:0 "Sir Stabby and his cohort of knights awaited on horseback at the main docks in Port Festiva. It was the middle of the night, the shipment from the Earth dimension was due to arrive and Her Highness Queen Moon did not want the public to be openly aware of the shipment. Through the fog, the human vessel arrived. Expecting a slow wooden craft, they were greeted by a monster size ship of metal, coated black as the night and moving against the wind at fast speeds as though it wasn’t there. Stabby himself pulled out his telescope and looked to the flag at the bow of the behemoth. A white background flag with a red star and a red stripe at the bottom. Center was a bear wearing a beaver top hat. Beneath it in Terran English and coincidently Low Mewman were the words, ‘Imperial California Republic’.\n\n"That’s the ship. A ‘gift’ from their Emperor Norton," Stabby remarked.\n\nHis squire, Higgs, was awe struck. "How did they fit this ship through a dimension tear?" she asked.\n\nThe human representative with them smiled and answered, “Your "Magic High Commision" was gracious enough to create a tear large enough for our ship, and the valuable cargo within."\n\nIt docked at Port Festiva’s largest mooring. As offboarding proceeded, the mewni dockmaster stood in awe of at the massive ship. The human captain however complained, remarking of the ‘tiny docks’ and how they could barely moore 'the smallest and oldest cargo ship in the Imperial Merchant Navy’. With a dozen heavy duty carts lined along the docks, all pulled by top breed warnicorns, the ship’s cranes loaded up the new equipment. The new machines would go far to relieve the kingdom’s pains. But the knights seemed skeptical at best.\n\nStill, Mr. Birnbaum assured them of Earth’s aid, "Rest assured, we stands ready to help. You but merely need to ask."\n\n"We’ll see about that, Earth man," said Stabby as he signaled the convoy to move out."

Lekmet, as the chancellor of the commission, began the meeting with a traditional speech, a few ‘baahh’s to fully commemorate the meeting. They then began in earnest.\n\nOne of the main agendas, along with the weakening of magic in the realm as of late, was Queen Moon’s new foreign policy. In the wake of reduced crop yields and widespread theft of the Butterfly Kingdom’s Corn Reserves, Moon has opted to look for foreign assistance. While many different dimensions border with Mewni, only Earth had the raw industrial and technological capability to quickly aid in modernizing Mewni’s food production. Already, Human staple crops such as wheat, rice, and tubers have surpassed current corn yields. And it has been new harvesting and canning machinery that has increased both the yield and shelf life of Mewni’s food reserves.\n\n'And their leader, Norton. I don’t trust him,’ said Rhombus.\n\nWhile the foreign aid was one issue, the more pressing one also was who was providing the aid. From the very first time they laid eyes on him, the MHC had no love for the human’s 'Emperor'. But Moon’s pressing on the issue has fallen flat. The Commission had only assured her that Joshua Norton and the human’s ‘assistance’ cannot be trusted. While Moon has her own doubts about the motives of the humans, outright rejection of aid so freely given to them would easily prove suicidal.\n\nWith Moon still ultimately in her right as Queen to decide, the Commission expected an answer from her on her plans moving forward."

Moon quickly entered her Mewberty form and flew up to dodge. With all her arms, she charged some weakened energy balls and fired at River, trying to hit just next to him. River tried to dodge, only to stagger into every single blast. Moon could hear his back crack.\n\n"Erm, are you sure you still want to do this?"\n\n"I'm fine, dear! I'm a Johansen, after all!" He advanced three steps towards her, only to collapse.\n\n"River!" Moon hovered down to him, still keeping her mewberty form. "Are you ok?" She supported him with her numerous hands, getting him on his knees.\n\n"M- Moonpie... i'm fine. My back is hurting is all. I can power through, I'm a Johansen." He loosley took his sword and swung it at her. The blade hit, but with not enough power to count.\n\n"You're an idiot, that's what you are." Moon took him in her arms and started carrying him out of the combat zone. "I think you've had enough sparring for today."\n\n"I don't care about my need for sparring, the whole point of us coming out here was for you! This isin't over until you've had enough, not me!" He reached into the hidden sword holster in his ankle to take out a dagger, but instead he pulled out a partially eaten corn-on-the-cob. "Oh, right, shouldn't have partied that hard a few days ago... No matter! En Garde!" He started swinging the dry piece of corn at her. Moon couldn't help but smile an adoring smile.\n\n"So you're pushing youself so much for me?"\n\n"I'm not pushing myself! But... yes. I'm doing this for you."\n\n"Aw, how sweet." She kissed him on the cheek. "But seriously, you're gonna hurt yourself. Live to fight another day, alright?"\n\n"...Fine, Moonpie." He dropped his corn. "But if you ever need more training, you know who to ask! I'm always happy to help, just... get me a Tylenol first.""

visit_avarius_family_event.1.d:0 "Riding fast and alone through the Forest of Certain Death, Queen Moon had left the duties of state to her husband, River. She made her way to the home of the Avarius family. Once upon a time, the Avarius family were the official Mewman-recognized rulers of the Forest of Certain Death, an ingenious ploy by Queen Crescenta Butterfly to create a monster tolerating state loyal to the Butterflys. Given that the Avariuses were obviously puppets, few monsters sided with them. The resulting Avarius Kingdom only spanned from the Northen tip of the Eastern monster mountain range, to the border of East Ponycorn. However, there was also a zone north of Stalward Valley, that was De Jure the Avarius' but De facto the Butterfly's. That zone is all that remains of the Avarius Kingdom ever since their son Ludo locked them out of their own castle.\n\nStanding at the door, the first greetings between Lord Brudo and Queen Moon was less than ideal. But with Moon's peace offering of corn, she was quickly welcomed.\n\n"So, what brings you here, Queen Moon?"\n\n"I’m here because your son took a very important book from my family."\n\n"My son? Crudo?" "Uh, no." "Yudo?" "Isn’t she your daughter?" "Menudo?" "Nope" "Okay, I’m just gonna go down the list. Dudo, Kudo, Mudo, Tudo, Fudo, Zudo, Udo... Not Dennis!?"\n\nMoon clarified. She was looking for Ludo. But the name wasn’t welcomed in their house. Ludo was the runt that disappointed their family, stole their home, and got it destroyed. They knew nothing, and were not trying to learn of Ludo’s whereabouts. Acknowledging a dead end, Moon departed.\n\nBut as she made her way back through the forest, she quickly noticed someone lurking throughout the tree line, quickly following along her path."

"We must go by wing, your highness."\n\nQuickly taking off, they flew south out of the forest and across the Butterfly Kingdom. They crossed the Mewni Waterway, and approached the mountains past Ecplipsa shoreline. They landed at an adjacent peak next to the old Monster Temple. Dennis pointed to where Ludo was, and Moon took out binoculars to see.\n\n"What is that...?"\n\nAs Ludo tasted the gruel he was cooking, a wand was next to him. On it was half of a shattered star, the exact piece which was missing from Star's wand. She urged Dennis, "We have to go. We have to go now!"\n\nThey quickly returned to the Forest of Certain Death, as a monster dropping the Queen off would be scandolous.\n\nHowever, as Queen Moon readied to return to depart, Dennis asked her, "Can you help him?""

Both their Warnicorns and carriage popped out of existence due to the Magic Fritz, and they were even attacked by a swarm of rats. After a long journey carrying the bodies of the Magic High Commision, they arrived.\n\nIt was a beautiful place, a colorful stony construct surrounded by water in the middle of the forest. The inside featured various waterworks, intricate ancient desgins spouting water. They laid the bodies of the MHC in some flower shaped pods, hoping to revive them. But it didn't work. Instead, as Moon turned a valve to pour regenerative water on them, black sludge poured out. The Magic Fritz had corrupted even this.\n\nMoon decided that she and Star must shelter in place until a better oppourtunity arose, and that they would have to subsist on corn snacks from the nearby vending machine. However, Star objected. Citing how she defeated Toffee before. But Moon struck that notion down, citing how Toffee had killed her own mother, Comet Butterfly, and that her wand was at half power.\n\nBut talking about the past remined Moon of something.

He had expected his wife to return by evening, but as he woke up the day after she was nowhere to be seen. And so, logically, he put on the music and tried to party yet again. He failed, his people too tired from the night before.\n\nThen an interdimensional portal appeared, and out came a boy. King River remembered him, Marco, an aquaintance of Star when she lived on earth. He asked him where Star was, as apparently she had left earth in a hurry. River had no idea where she or his own wife were, or even when they were gonna return. Marco was alarmed by this, and asked to stay by River's side for the day. He agreed, and let him follow him around.\n\nThe boy was surprisingly helpful, his new perspective making River realize the kingdom was suffering from multiple problems that have poppped up while he was partying. Of these are garbage piling up, multiple buildings on fire, and a giant monster in the cornfields. River decided to deal with the Monster first, rallying the people with a rousing speech of "The Ordinary doing the Extraordinary!" and how "You don't need magic to do magical things!"\n\nWith a large inspired mob brandishing torches and pitchforks, they sallied forth. Due to the operation's disorganized nature, they had to leave the gates open for any peasant who was running late. However, once they reached the monster, a quick communication cleared things up. Apparently, when people were waving the monster to go away, the monster mininterpreted it as a signal to come closer.
