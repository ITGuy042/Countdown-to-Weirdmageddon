    mystery_shack.2.d:0 "There once was a man, not unlike me, who lived in this old, run-down shack. Smart, a genius really, if not also a bit of a stuck-up idiot at times. But standing in front of this invention of his, its humbling really. This was his achievement of a lifetime, a gateway to the universe and beyond. Its was his rise and because of me, it would be his fall.\n\nThirty years ago, that man was lost from our world, sucked up by the portal and into parts unknown. He was gone and I have labored since. To repair, to rebuild, to reinvent what I had thought anyway was the product of his mind. In his lost, I was changed to a new man. In my lost, he became known as a changed man. Across all the universe, across countless dimensions and realms that go beyond human comprehension, my quest to bring him back had led me to find more about myself. In that portal, I felt reborn, I felt broken, I stood on the shoulders of gods, and I saw where I really laid among the vast infinity.\n\nMaybe nothing has changed. But as that man once said, even in an isolated environment, nothing stays the same. I am not the man they think I am. I am not who I seem to be."

    stantastic_51.1.d:0 "'Now let's see. 37GH7? No, they already know my face. 9I8/Q? No, I rather not get squeezed to death by an overly-sensitive octopus'\n\nStan slurped his can of Pitt Cola and scratched himself as he stared at the coordinates screen of the portal. From memory, he inputted different dimension coordinates, giving the screen a look before dismissing it. Many worlds he has traveled to; Nearly that many worlds he has been banned from too. After spending half the night idly scrolling through his notebooks of dimensions, one crossed his mind.\n\n'C-137! Birdperson owes me money!' He got his coat on, but stopped and turned back, 'Forgot, Rick monsterfied that,' he toggled the dial to the other dimension he was now in, 'I hope this Birdperson also owes me money. And now to initialize the portal and-'\n\nThe portal abruptly turned off. The shutdown cascaded as the light in the control room went dark as well. Stan looked around in darkness, before a small side screen lit up in a dark red. Stan reached out and felt for his chair, then sat down to read the screen.\n\n'Energy Reactor: Empty'\n\nThe sight brought dread and annoyance. Stan had not had to refill the fuel source in years. He wasn't even using nuclear fuel. He was surprised it lasted as long as he did. But now he needed an Earth Base source. But where to get nuclear energy? The easiest would be nuclear waste, still rich in radioactive material. But the US transitioned to thorium after SDI was introduced. It won't be laying around in Oregon...\n\nStan sighed at the thought. He was going to need to make a short road trip out of state to get what he needed.'"

With a few days free to mosey on down and sneak past the Nevada State lines, he could go to the one place that would still have barrels of radioactive waste laying about. What's even better still is that the apparent collapse of the United States had made an opportunity to sneak in even better.\n\nAs far as he was concerned, it was going to be a very Homey place to be."
    stantastic_51.2.a:0 "'Like taking radioactive candy from an overfunded government baby'"
    
    stantastic_51.3.t:0 "A Homey place to be"
    stantastic_51.3.d:0 "Stan wasn't a stranger to Homey Air Force Base. He wasn't ignorant to the fact it was the infamous Area 51, a front for the Federal Paranormal Investigations. As he drove to his hiding spot to stage his break-in, he wasn't alone. Thousands of weirdos and nerds were all camped in the middle of the Nevadan desert. Blending into the crowd so close to the base, he learned they had gathered to launch a raid on Area 51.\n\n'Save the aliens, liberate E.T., uncover the truth, they can’t stop all of us!'\n\nStan couldn't help but laugh at their dumb plan. Aliens? Government secrets? Stan knew better. Area 51 was a backwater storage site for the FPI for decades now. It started with Roswell when an alien ship blew up a weather balloon as a sort of interstellar prank, only to crash their ship in some cosmic karma retribution. The FPI had to move all alien sites to random locations outside the country thanks to all the journalists thinking the base was where the aliens were. Stan had to admit, making everyone think Area 51 had the aliens instead of a base on a deserted island in the Pacific was genius.\n\nHe pondered. 'If only I brought some souvenirs to sell to these suckers.'\n\nBut he had a mission. And now two ways in. There was a secret passage along the ridge to the west he normally used to sneak through and the distraction of the nerds raiding the entrance would ensure no one was guarding it. But alternatively, the base is understaffed since the Kerfuffle and he could just join the raiders and follow right behind them as they overwhelm the base. Stan thought to himself, it would be more fun."

    stantastic_51.4.t:0 "The Man sent from S.H.A.C.K."
    stantastic_51.4.d:0 "After a short hike through Papoose Mountain, Stan slid down the ridge approaching the west end of Homey Airbase. As he approached the perimeter, he ducked behind some crates as Federal Air Force MPs and ran by. There were shouting, explosions, and a huge commotion on the other side of the base. As everyone turned their attention to the raiders, Stan quickly crossed the base and entered a door into the main hanger.\n\nAs red lights flashed and the air siren rang out outside, he reached the main office, abandoned in the distraction. File drawer by file drawer, he pulled out paperwork for anything about the waste. Quartermaster inventory, shipping manifestos, radiological reports. Nothing. This base wasn’t even serving as a storage depot anymore. An empty husk, no technology, no advanced exotic material, just a blip on the map to distract the populace. Anything useful was shipped out long before the kerfuffle, to other sites still useful on the continent. \n\nAs he sat down in exhaustion, he noticed two other reports. One, a material, Code Named- Sweat of Hercules. He read through it, realizing what the material really was. And he read the location. Fort Teller, Washington. Closer, but not any easier to approach as it housed the American SDI System. But even one drop can fuel his machine for another dozen years. The other report was a barrel of radioactive carbon retrieved from a STALKER for the FPI, still on-base after it had fallen off the truck near the gate when the last shipment left. He read the radiological samples. It was perfect. Not a lot of fuel, but enough for the meantime. At least he had a new site to scope out, and something to bring back home.\n\nTwo soldiers burst into the office. Stan stood up and raised his hands. He noticed their uniform and the armbands they wore. They weren’t Federal Soldiers, they were Californian, Imperial Soldiers. With no time to ponder how they are here, he slipped a smoke bomb from his coat and gassed the room. In the smoke, he fled and rushed to the main hangar wing. Looking at the second report, he got to the truck holding the barrel. Turning the engine on, he noticed a crate labeled ‘Corn Juice’. He shivered at the thought."

    stantastic_51.5.t:0 "The Desert Moth"
    stantastic_51.5.d:0 "As imperial soldiers began to open the hangers doors, General Sherman Pines walked over to watch. As the gap widened, Stan burst right through with the truck in full gear. General Pines ducked out of the way as the truck veered out of the way and crashed through some empty crates. The soldiers formed up around the general and prepared to open fire, but Pines raised his hand to hold fire. He turned to his XO, a marine major. He nodded his head, and she nodded back. She began to run after the truck.\n\n‘Is that marine running after me?’ Stan looked back before turning eyes forward, ‘Shermie’s right about those crayon-eating-’ He looked at his rear view mirror. A bright light approached from behind at high speeds. He adjusted the mirror, focusing in on the source. A woman with two large wide moth wings, three arms on each side, approached him fast. He pondered, ‘Is that Moon?’ Finally, she got close enough, the details of her marine formal uniform being made out, as well as her six hands charging for a blast.\n\n‘By the authority of the Imperial California Republic, stop the vehicle immediately!’\n\n‘Huh, it’s Emily... Oh no, Mewberty Emily!’\n\nA strong magic blast struck just behind the truck. Stan veered to the right, making it pass the blown out fence and into the desert. She let out another roar and flung her arms at the truck, unleashing another magic blast. Stan slammed the brakes to dodge the shot, then banked left to regain distance from her. With his niece in hot pursuit, he scoped the grounds around him for an escape route. Dodging another blast that nearly threw the truck clear, he reached into the crate for a drink of the corn juice. \n\nInstead, he pulled out a vial filled with a yellow substance. Grossed out for a moment, he released what it was, seeing the substance give an ever mute glitter.\n\n‘Magic Water!’\n\nLooking back at the pursuing Emily Pines, he came up with a plan."

    stantastic_51.6.d:0 "Stan acted quickly. Grabbing what he could from the glove compartment, he locked the wheel and gas pedal in place. Opening the rear window on to the flatbed, he climbed out with the crate of ‘corn juice’. With Major Emily Pines right behind him, Stan pulled out some vails, popped them open and began tossing the water at her.\n\n‘What the heck? Eww, gross!\n\n‘This is as awkward for me as it is for you!’\n\nStan kept uncorking and coating her with the magic water, each splash driving her back a bit. The magic of the water from the realm of magic slowly began to take its effect. Stan emptied out the crate, tossing out the last vials of water at her. Down to his last vial, he needed to make it count. All the while, Emily refocused her effort and got even closer, now just mere feets away from grabbing him. Stan then pulled off his balaclava and revealed his face.\n\n‘Emily!’\n\n‘Uncle Stan?’\n\nDistracted, he threw the bottle right at her, smashing dead center on her face. Glass shards scattered about in the high speed pursuit and the magic water drenched her. Emily’s mewberty form rendering her impervious to the glass. But then, she stopped. Stan looked on. Her eyes were wide open, her pupils replaced with bright glittering stars. She smiled at her uncle, worrying the old man, then she flew straight upward into the air. Stan looked on as she opened up a dimensional tear and disappeared through it. He broke out in laughter, cheering for himself and his success.\n\n‘Haha! I’ll make it up to you for Christmas!’\n\nHe sat back down on the flatbed to rest. He stared at the barrel of radioactive carbon. Then something else struck him."

    stantastic_51.7.t:0 "Love and Grand Theft in Las Vegas"
    stantastic_51.7.d:0 "Stan flew forward when the truck drove itself right into a ditch. He tucked and rolled to cusion his landing. It was not the first time he had gotten himself ejected from a moving platform at high speeds. When he finally came to stop, he rolled over and stared up at the sky. Dark, peaceful. Nothing but rock, sand, and cactuses. He could make a bright light on the horizon. Sitting up, he realized it was Las Vegas in the distance.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he walked back to the truck. Seeing it stuck in the ditch outside Vegas, he began to ponder to himself. This wasn’t the first time he was here. His vehicle in a ditch after a lengthy car chase. Looking around, the land around him wasn’t too different as well. He looked up at the night sky once again. Squinting his aging eyes, he still made out that symbol he once knew so long ago, still being formed by the same stars, in both their worlds. Looking back at the truck, he laughed at himself.\n\n‘I guess I can’t blame you this time, huh?’\n\nHe took out that report he found and read it again. ‘The Sweat of Hercules’. Only someone strong, brave, and outright foolish like Hercules would try to get it once. Looking at the back of the truck and its single barrel of fuel, Stan realized he was even dumber than that greek prick. But if he wanted his brother back, he needed the Blood of the Titan. Under lock and key, maybe he needed to go to the source. He picked up a rock and tossed it at the truck, missing entirley."

    stantastic_51.8.d:0 "Stan gathered with the group as they marched on the entrance onto the base proper. He stayed back at the end, having no intent to stick out among the rest or get shot by the guards. As they approached the gate, it exploded. More explosions could be seens along the gate perimeter, the shockwave knocking them down. In the shouting and sirens came the rumbling of machinery behind them. Over the hills, tanks appeared and stormed down the bludd towards the base. On the leading tank was the flag of California flying ever heroically. Norton’s empire was striking the base, using the raiders as a distraction.\n\nThe raiders disperse as tanks and infantry charged through the fence and into the base. Stan hid behind some bush as it all happened. As he watched, he saw a humvee stop nearby. Stan ducked his head as two people got out.\n\n‘Status on our forces?’ he asked.\n\n‘Swiftly advancing across the base. Seems Guzman’s files were right. A backwater location, the lights kept on to keep appearances. Most of the base personnel have already surrendered,’ she handed him a tablet, ‘We already downloaded the base’s manifest.’\n\nStan whispered to himself, ‘Manifest?’\n\nStan snuck around, approaching them from behind. He pulled over his balaclava and pulled out his taser. Ever quietly, he tiptoed right up to them. At the last moment, his taser charged, the woman turned around with a roundhouse kick in mid air. Stan dropped to the desert ground and rolled to the side as she dropped her boot straight down where his face was. Stan jumped back up, pushed his back in and charged forward. She easily dodged, grabbed his arm, and pinned him. He looked at her, chuckling as a smoke bomb fell off his sleeve.\n\nSmoke engulfed them and Stan broke free and tasered her. The man pulled out his side arm and pointed it at the smoke. The only thing that came out was his daughter falling to the ground. As he approached, Stan whacked him behind the head. He grabbed the tablet and took a moment to take a look at the two of them.\n\n'Shermie, Emily?! Ah geez, this is... *sigh* The next family reunion is going to be weird.'\n\nHe took the tablet. Radioactive carbon! Yes! And a material code named Sweats of Hercules? He’ll read it later. Now, undressing his older brother for his clothes and getting into the humvee, it's time to get that radioactive waste."

    stantastic_51.9.d:0 "Being ‘Stanford’ or ‘Shermie’ wasn’t a difficult thing to pull off for the Man of Mystery. He walked right in and drove the truck off. Soldiers either didn’t bat an eye or simply gave a quick salute to him as he drove right out the blown out front gate. After loading the barrel into his car, he hightailed it out of there and back to Las Vegas.\n\n‘If only marching into heavily guarded government facilities were that easy!’\n\nHe snickered at the thought and reached for a can of Pitt. As he drove into city lines, he took a drink and stared up at a passing billboard.\n\n‘Give Lady Luck a spin on the Cash Wheel! Auditions today at the Northwest Tower!’\n\nStan smiled. He already had what he wanted. Why not squeeze his luck for all its worth? Radioactive waste and winning a bet with his grandniece would truly be the best Las Vegas vacation he ever had."

    stantastic_51.10.d:0 "After scaring away other contestants, possibly committing insurance fraud involving a glass of water, and (initially) faking a heart attack, Stan got his shot to be a contestant on the Cash Wheel. Standing at the far end of the wheel, Rich Richardson and Carla Blanco walked out on set as the theme song of Cash Wheel played. With a little banter, they parted ways, Carla to the letter board and Rich to the contestants.\n\n‘Ladies and Gentleman! Welcome to, Cash Wheel!’ Rich smoothly pointed over to the three contestants, ‘Now lets meet those contestants!’\n\n‘I’m Doug, from Fairfield, California.’\n\n‘I’m Donna, from-’\n\n‘I’m Stan! Stan Pines, haha!’ The camera automatically moved away but Stan quickly reentered the frame, ‘Did we, did we already do me, hello? I’m Stan!’\n\nRich gave a nervous chuckle. Stan was not going to be a regular contestant."
    stantastic_51.10.a:0 "‘Okay... Well, it's gonna be a long night folks.’"
    
    stantastic_51.11.t:0 "May I *blank* have that?"
    stantastic_51.11.d:0 "‘Ladies and gentleman, Stan Pines is poised to become our grand champion! Anything to say to your fans out there?’\n\n‘See you tomorrow night, Mabel! Hahah!’\n\nRude, arrogant, full of hot air and the sole reason tonight’s episode was rated TV-MA, Stan had won piles of money and the love of the crowd. Even Rich was impressed by his showman vibrato that captivated the crowd and the viewers at home. With his clothes, thankfully, back on again, Stan leaned back on his pile of money. Money, radiation, winning a bet with a twelve year old girl, it didn’t get any better than that.\n\n‘I’m giving none of this to charity!’\n\nAs the crowd cheered on, Rich approached him, giving Stan the chance to beat even that accomplishment.\n\n‘And now you can go home a thousander. Or you can risk everything to double your money with, ‘The Bonus Word’!’\n\nStan straightened his tie and spoke, ‘Rich, I’m a simple man. So I’m going to take my winnings, pack my bag and... bet them all on the bonus word! Come on!’"
